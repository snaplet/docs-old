## Understanding seed data

Seed data is a useful tool in software development, providing an initial set of data for your database.

Here's why it's beneficial:

- **Development:** Provides a consistent dataset for developers.
- **Testing:** Ensures predictability when verifying features.
- **Demonstration:** Showcases your software's abilities with example content.
- **Default Data:** Adds necessary built-ins, like country lists.
- **Onboarding:** Gives new users a filled-out starting point.
- **Performance:** Helps simulate heavy usage scenarios.
- **Guides:** Common reference in tutorials.

While seed data might be the unsung hero of early development, it can get a bit needy as software evolves. But don't sweat it! Our mission is to save you from the never-ending saga of maintaining those seed scripts. Who has time for that, right?

## The Snaplet Data Client

The key to effortless seed data is a tool that deeply understands your database's schema. By introspecting your database, we create a fully-typed client dedicated to data generation.

Right now, the Snaplet Data Client is tied to our configuration file, but we intend to generate a standalone version that you will be able to use anywhere!

### Usage

Given the database schema:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
    <img align="center" width="500" src="/img/snaplet-example-schema.png" alt="you branch?" />
</div>

Our requirements are:

- Creating a post with the title "There is a lot of snow around here!".
- The author of the post has an email that ends with "acme.org".
- This post receives 3 comments.

Here is what the plan looks like using the Snaplet Data Client:

```typescript title="snaplet.config.ts"
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />

import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    plan({ snaplet }) {
      return snaplet.Post({
        data: {
          title: 'There is a lot of snow around here!',
          User: {
            data: {
              email: ({ seed }) => copycat.email(seed, { domain: 'acme.org' }),
            },
          },
          Comment: {
            count: 3,
          },
        },
      })
    },
  },
});
```

> We drew significant inspiration from our friends at [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). If you're familiar with Prisma, using the Snaplet Data Client will feel incredibly intuitive and seamless.

To see the SQL statements produced by your plan, run:

```bash
snaplet generate --sql
```

To execute these SQL statements against your configured target database, run:

```bash
snaplet generate
```

Here are the SQL statements generated by the Snaplet Data Client:

```sql
INSERT INTO public."User" (email, id, name) VALUES
-- This is the author of the post, notice the "acme.org" in the email

### Architecture and concepts

When generating data with the Snaplet Data Client, you are manipulating **plans**. A plan is a description of the data that you want to generate.

When a plan is executed, its internal **store** is populated with the generated data. A store is a simple in-memory map of your models containing arrays of generated values.

At the end of the process, the values contained in the store are turned into SQL statements.
