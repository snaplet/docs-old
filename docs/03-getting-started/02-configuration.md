# Configuration

Once youâ€™ve [installed the Snaplet CLI](/getting-started/start-here#installing-the-cli), youâ€™ll need to configure Snaplet for your project. 

1. Run `snaplet config setup` in the directory containing your projectâ€™s source code.
    1. This command creates a `.snaplet` directory and the configuration files used by the CLI.
    2. Add these files (`.snaplet/config.json`, `.snaplet/snaplet.d.ts`, `.snaplet/id_rsa`, and `snaplet.config.ts`) to your projectâ€™s code repository. This will ensure your team uses the values you've specified.
2. This command will also prompt you to provide your **target database credentials** in the form of a connection string.

_ðŸ’¡ Note: Your **target database** is where snapshots are restored to by Snaplet - itâ€™s typically your local development database that your code operates against. Your **source database** is what we capture a snapshot from - typically your production database._

If you intend to code against your local database, use those credentials when prompted for your target database credentials. If you intend to restore this snapshot to an external database thatâ€™s acting as your development database, for instance, a Vercel or Neon database, use the connection string from that provider here when prompted. 


```bash 
$ cd path/to/project-404/
# highlight-next-line
$ snaplet config setup

> > No existing configuration found. A configuration contains variables
that adjust the settings of the CLI
? Set up "~/gh/path/to/project-404"? [Y/n] y
> Updated ".gitignore"...

> > Enter development database connection credentials:
? postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/my-project-database

> Introspecting database...
> Wrote ".snaplet/config.json"
> Wrote ".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts"
> Wrote ".snaplet/id_rsa"
```


:::note Typescript support

For the `snaplet.config.ts` file to have its full autocompletion capabilities, you need to turn on two typescript compiler options in the `tsconfig.json` of your project:
    
    ```json
    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            "strict": true,
            "noImplicitAny": true
        }
    }
    ```

We have guides specifically for [Vercel](/tutorials/vercel-postgres) and [Neon](/tutorials/neon) integrations if you need more information.

If youâ€™re having connection string issues, read more about connection strings and encoding [here](/references/connection-strings/).

With your configuration set up, you're ready to start restore your first snapshot using the Snaplet CLI! Let's [restore that snapshot](/getting-started/restoring) now.
